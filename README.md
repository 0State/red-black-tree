Implementation of (advanced) data structure: red-black tree
Julienne Walker's Eternally Confused was a huge help to understanding  how a red-black tree's insertion and deletion worked. In fact this implementation is almost a carbon copy of it, obly with an OOP approach and a slight tweak to the insertion function. I hope this will be a help to all of you.
